"""status.py — the campaign-wide job table (read-only observation).

Backs ``mechababs status``. Distinct from ``babs_status.py``, which parses one
cell's ``babs status --json`` for the reconciler to decide on; this one is for a
human looking at the whole campaign at once.

babs tracks jobs per-cell in each project's ``code/job_status.csv``, which carries no
dataset/pipeline column and names every job ``bid`` — so answering "which job was
that dataset's failing subject?" otherwise means log-filename -> ``sacct``
gymnastics. This aggregates every babs project's CSV across the campaign into ONE
table, tagging each row with its dataset + pipeline (derived from the path) and
computing each job's stderr log path, so a failure points straight at its log.

Read-only by construction: it never writes campaign state, so it costs no
provenance — observability is free, unlike a run-config change.

The CSV is a *cache* babs recomputes from ``sacct``. By default each matched cell is
refreshed (``babs status``) before rendering so ``state``/``time_used``/``is_failed``
are live; ``--no-refresh`` skips that and accepts what's on disk. Refresh is
deliberately the default: a stale row can show a *running* job as failed (babs's
submit path rewrites a resubmitted row's job_id without clearing the prior attempt's
``is_failed``), so reading the cache is an explicit choice, not an accident.

Columns are read **by name** (``csv.DictReader``), never by position — babs's CSV is
not a contracted API, so a reordering is safe here and a missing column renders
empty rather than crashing.
