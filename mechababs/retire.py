"""retire.py — retire a derivative out of its study into ``derivative-attempts/``.

Backs ``mechababs retire-derivative <path>...``. A cell that has to be redone (a
resource change, a tool bug, a config fix) leaves behind a derivative that is no
longer wanted in the study but is still worth keeping: its logs, its git history,
and its ``[DATALAD RUNCMD]`` records are the evidence for *why* it was redone.
Deleting it throws that away; leaving it in place blocks the re-scaffold. So it is
moved to the campaign's ``derivative-attempts/`` and the cell is reset.

The move preserves the dataset: a derivative's ``.git`` is a real directory (not a
gitlink file), so it is self-contained on disk, and its ``datalad-id`` survives — the
parked dataset is the *same* dataset relocated, not a copy.

**A retired derivative is an archive, not a resumable babs project.** babs bakes
ABSOLUTE RIA paths in at init (which is why babs projects cannot be relocated at
all), so after the move the derivative's ``input``/``output`` siblings still point at
its old ``studies/study-<id>/derivatives/<name>/.babs/…`` location, which no longer
exists. Nothing is lost — the RIA stores live under ``.babs/`` and travel with it —
but every recorded reference is dangling, so **babs commands will not work on it and
neither will ``datalad get``/``push`` through those siblings**. Read its logs, its git
history, and its content; do not expect to resume the run in place. Retire a cell you
intend to redo from scratch, not one you mean to continue.

Naming: ``derivative-attempts/<dataset_id>-<derivative>-attempt-<N>``.
A submodule's name IS its path, so two datasets retiring the same pipeline would
collide on one path without the ``<dataset_id>`` prefix; ``attempt-<N>`` (the first
free slot) disambiguates the same cell being retired more than once.

**Resetting the ledger cell is part of the same transition, not a follow-up.** The
derivative directory name is the pipeline's short_name, so retiring clears that
row's ``<short>_babs``/``<short>_babs-merged`` columns — which is what actually
returns the cell to "not started" so the next ``iterate`` re-scaffolds it. Doing it
inside the one scope means there is no window where the derivative is gone but the
ledger still routes the cell as in-progress, no hand-edit to forget, and the whole
retirement is one labeled node in the campaign's provenance.
