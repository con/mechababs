"""guard.py — preconditions that protect the campaign's provenance integrity.

A campaign records the exact babs + mechababs it ran as pinned subdatasets
(code/babs, code/mechababs). That provenance link is only *causal* — the
derivative was produced by the code the superdataset points at — if the vendored
code that actually runs matches the recorded pin. Uncommitted edits in code/*, or
a checked-out commit that differs from the recorded gitlink, break that: the run
would be attributed to a pin it did not use. So refuse to run when the pins are
dirty.

Scope is deliberately the *pins*, not the whole campaign: an in-progress
derivative left untracked by `iterate` is expected working state, not a
provenance lie. Making the whole campaign clean after each step (so a broader
guard could hold) is the matched postcondition tracked separately (#52).
