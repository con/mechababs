# run_on_cluster.sh — run the mechababs e2e scenario on a REAL cluster's login
# node, against a real cluster config. The counterpart to run_in_podman.sh (which
# runs everything inside the slurm-docker-ci container); here the cluster IS the
# substrate, so there is no container — pytest runs directly on the login node and
# the campaign submits real SLURM jobs.
#
# This validates an HPC config more thoroughly than `babs check-setup`: it drives
# the whole campaign path (bootstrap -> configure -> add-dataset -> iterate:
# scaffold -> submit -> wait -> merge) and asserts a real derivative landed.
#
# Design: the invocation is UNIFORM across sites — every cluster runs the same
# command. Per-site differences (module loads, PATH, scratch roots) live in the
# cluster YAML's script_preamble, NOT in flags to this script. So this wrapper only
# guards the environment contract and hands off to pytest; extra args pass through.
#
# Prerequisites (see docs/cluster-config-and-testing-tutorial.md for the full walk):
#   - a Python env with the test deps:  pip install -e '.[test]'
#   - git, uv, and apptainer/singularity on PATH
#   - MECHABABS_E2E_WORKDIR set to cluster scratch (campaign + shim live there)
#   - the container shim built there ONCE:
#       REPRONIM=$MECHABABS_E2E_WORKDIR/repronim-containers-shim \
#           tmp-repronim-container-shim.sh bids-simbids
#   - BABS_SPEC set until `babs status --json` (PennLINC/babs#387) is in babs main
#
# Usage (extra args pass straight through to pytest):
#   ./tests/e2e/run_on_cluster.sh --cluster-config your-site.yaml
#   ./tests/e2e/run_on_cluster.sh --cluster-config your-site.yaml -k test_full_run
