"""Full-run scenario: drive the campaign CLI through the whole happy path and assert.

configure -> add-dataset -> iterate (scaffold via `babs init`) -> iterate (submit)
-> `babs status --wait` (block until the jobs finish) -> iterate (merge). Asserts the
ledger + babs project at scaffold, then the merged column + a produced derivative.

This is the piece that exercises the reconciler's ACTIVE-cell path
(decide_action -> babs_status.read_status -> decide -> ITERATE_ACTIONS): the second
tick decides "submit", the third decides "merge". Full-run tier = simbids only (light
enough to actually submit+run under the slurm-docker-ci slurm); the scaffold
assertions here double as the scaffold tier.
