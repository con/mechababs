"""pytest fixtures for the mechababs e2e harness.

Locally this runs INSIDE the pennlinc/slurm-docker-ci container (launched by
run_in_podman.sh); on a real cluster it runs on the login node. Either way the
scenario drives the campaign CLI, so the fixtures provide everything it needs:

- `simbids_sif` — the simbids container, from the shim built once as host-prep
  (`tmp-repronim-container-shim.sh bids-simbids`). This is a temporary seam: when
  babs#383 lands + simbids is upstreamed to ReproNim/containers, only this fixture
  changes (shim path -> ReproNim `datalad get`).
- `rawdata` — fake BIDS input, generated once into a gitignored repo cache. Prod
  uses real OpenNeuro data, so fake input is a test-only concern that lives in the
  test, not in any prod tool.
- `campaign` — the bootstrapped campaign env (provisioning), exercising prod's
  real bootstrap.sh construction path.
