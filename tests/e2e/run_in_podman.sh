# run_in_podman.sh — run the mechababs e2e scenario inside the slurm-docker-ci
# container, under ROOTLESS podman.
#
# Increment 1 runs everything INSIDE pennlinc/slurm-docker-ci (bootstrap-across-
# the-boundary is a later fidelity step). This launches the container with the
# mechababs repo mounted and runs pytest inside. Mirrors babs's tests/e2e_in_docker.sh.
#
# Rootless: no root daemon, and container-root maps to the invoking host user via
# userns — so nothing here runs as real root and any host-touching bytes are
# user-owned (root-in / user-out). slurm-docker-ci comes up rootless with no
# --privileged (verified: podman 5.8.2, cgroups v2). SELinux is handled with
# `label=disable` rather than per-mount `:Z`: one of the mounts is the shared
# git-common-dir, and `:Z` would relabel it on the host and disturb sibling
# worktrees — disabling the label for this container relabels nothing. Two extras
# the nested workload needs, NEITHER of which adds a Linux capability or breaks
# root-in/user-out (we add ZERO caps — no --cap-add, no --privileged):
#   --device /dev/fuse                singularity mounts the squashfs SIF via FUSE,
#                                     and rootless podman doesn't expose it by
#                                     default (a device, not a cap).
#   --security-opt systempaths=unconfined
#                                     a babs job runs simbids via `singularity run`
#                                     INSIDE this container; apptainer (with --userns,
#                                     set on the simbids pipeline) creates a nested
#                                     user+PID namespace and mounts a fresh /proc onto
#                                     it. The kernel only allows that when the caller
#                                     has a FULLY-VISIBLE /proc, but podman MASKS
#                                     /proc paths by default -> "mount proc: operation
#                                     not permitted". systempaths=unconfined unmasks
#                                     /proc so the nested mount is allowed. It relaxes
#                                     THIS container's view of /proc, not host
#                                     privilege — container-root still maps to the
#                                     unprivileged host user. (Scaffold-only runs —
#                                     `babs init`, no inner container — don't need it.)
#
# The campaign is built on a host bind mount at $MECHABABS_E2E_WORKDIR, mounted at
# the SAME absolute path inside the container. Same-path is deliberate: babs bakes
# *absolute* RIA-store paths at init, so building at an identical host==container
# path is what lets the campaign resolve — and stay operable — on the host after the
# run. It persists regardless of --rm (it lives on the host, not the container
# layer); MECHABABS_E2E_KEEP=1 only additionally keeps the *container* for post-mortem.
#
# Host-prep ONCE first — build the shim (the prod container-shim command; dies at
# babs#383):
#   REPRONIM=$MECHABABS_E2E_WORKDIR/repronim-containers-shim \
#       tmp-repronim-container-shim.sh bids-simbids
# It sits as a campaign sibling under $MECHABABS_E2E_WORKDIR (default /tmp/mechababs-e2e),
# visible through the same-path workdir mount, so configure resolves the pipeline's
# `../repronim-containers-shim`. The fake BIDS input is NOT host-prep — the
# rawdata fixture generates it into the gitignored repo cache tests/e2e/_cache, which
# we bind-mount read-write (over the :ro repo) so it persists across runs.
#
# Usage (extra args pass straight through to pytest):
