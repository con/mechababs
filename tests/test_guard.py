"""Unit tests for the pin-cleanliness guard (guard.require_clean_pins).

The guard runs `git status --porcelain -- code/mechababs code/babs` at the
campaign superdataset level. In prod code/* are submodules; here they are plain
tracked subdirs — the guard command and its empty/non-empty contract are
identical either way, so a subdir campaign faithfully exercises the logic without
the weight of real submodules. (Submodule HEAD-drift is caught by the same
command and covered by the e2e.)
