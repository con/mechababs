"""Make the `mechababs` package importable in unit tests without an editable
install, so `pytest tests/test_*.py` runs from a bare checkout.

Scoped to the whole tests/ tree; the e2e suite (tests/e2e/) drives the campaign
venv's `mechababs` binary via subprocess rather than importing package logic, but
it does import shared constants (e.g. the ledger filename) to assert against.
