"""Unit tests for iterate helpers that are pure once their inputs are on disk.

`study_sourcedata_url` reads the raw input URL from a cloned study's `.gitmodules`
under both naming conventions — OpenNeuroStudies (plain git) names the section by
dataset id, a datalad-built study (e.g. the e2e fixture) names it by path. Both
resolve here with only `git` + a written `.gitmodules`; no clone, no fetch.
