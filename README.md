# mechababs

Automation glue for running BIDS apps across many OpenNeuro datasets on HPC
clusters using [BABS](https://github.com/PennLINC/babs).

mechababs is an end-to-end harness for running BABS across clusters and many datasets.
It runs **vanilla** BABS by default (`PennLINC/babs` main, or a PR branch under test), and can use a babs fork when one is needed.
The unit of work is a **campaign**: a self-contained datalad dataset that holds its inputs, its outputs, its config, its state ledger, and the exact `babs` + `mechababs` code that produced everything.

Every run composes three axes — **a dataset** × **a pipeline** (`pipelines/*.yaml`) × **a cluster** (`clusters/*.yaml`) — and `mechababs iterate` reconciles the campaign toward the state you declared, one tick at a time.

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Build a campaign (needs only git + uv on PATH; run once per campaign).
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/con/mechababs/main/bootstrap.sh \
  | bash -s -- my-campaign

cd my-campaign
source .venv/bin/activate

# 2. Bind an ordered pipeline-set to a cluster.
mechababs configure --pipelines MRIQC-24.0.2.yaml --cluster dartmouth.yaml [--limit N]

# 3. Register datasets by URL.
mechababs add-dataset https://github.com/OpenNeuroDatasets/ds005896

# 4. Advance the campaign one reconciler tick at a time until it's done.
mechababs iterate
```

New to a cluster? Get the prerequisites in place ([installation.md](docs/installation.md)), then validate your HPC config by running the e2e suite on it — see the [cluster config & testing tutorial](docs/cluster-config-and-testing-tutorial.md).
